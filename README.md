# Hi there 👋
My name is David Wiggs, and I’ve been testing in production since 2012. I was born, raised, and went to school in Champaign, IL, and currently live in Chicago. I enjoy spending time with my wonderful fiancé, gardening, and even have a gear bag full of paintball equipment that doesn’t get enough use. You will probably hear me talk about my two dogs, Bert and Raymond, at some point if we ever meet.
